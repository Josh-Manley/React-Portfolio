          Web/software development and coding has always been an interest of mine, it is intriguing and satisfying 
          to solve a problem within the code and creating something from scratch and seeing it come together overtime. 
          I've recently decided to make a career change to do something more beneficial with my career life and this seemed like the right direction.
